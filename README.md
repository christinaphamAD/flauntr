Project Description (What it does, how you went about it, etc.)

This application will provide users with an easy interface that will allow people to 
pull up their photos from different sets and drag and drop them into "tag-buckets", 
allowing for consistent and easy mass-tagging. We also provided an autocomplete function
so that a list of suggested tags related to whatever you typed will show up, possibly
providing users with better alternatives or proper spelling. 

Features: 
- User sign-in and authentication
- Ability to create multiple tag buckets
- Drag and Drop feature to easily throw photos into tag buckets
- Ability to trash photos from tag buckets for users to change their minds
- Autocomplete that will pull up a list of suggested related tags based on what you type
- Gallery viewer so that users can view their photo at a bigger size

Usernames we tested with: 
- closetbug
- rohan's username (???) *FIX*

Technologies Used: 
- Christina Pham: jQuery, jQuery UI, Dreamweaver, TextWrangler (compare)
